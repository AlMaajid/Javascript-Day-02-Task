1. Write a blog on the difference between document and window objects

/----- Document -----/

-> It represents any HTML document or web page that is loaded in browser.

-> It is loaded inside the window.

-> It is the object of window property.

-> We can access the document from window using the window.document

-> The document is part of BOM and DOM

-> Syntax: document.propertyName;

-> Example: document.title: will return the title of the document.

/----- Window -----/

-> It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage.

-> It is very first object that is loaded in the browser.

-> It is the object of the browser.

-> We can access the window from the window only. i.e, window.window

-> The window is part of BOM, not DOM.

-> Syntax: window.propertyName;

-> Example: window.innerHeight: will return the height of the content area of the browser.
